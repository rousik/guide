  "about": "As we learn more about COVID-19, a simple graph has gone viral: ‚ÄúFlatten the Curve.‚Äù Praised for shedding light on the scale and speed of the outbreak, it illustrates the wave of expected COVID-19 cases.\n\n- A high curve means the virus is spreading quickly; some people won‚Äôt get the medical care they need, and the number of deaths is likely to increase.\n- A flattened curve means COVID-19 is spreading slowly, staggering the rate of people with COVID-19 and giving doctors time to best utilize scarce resources to treat people and save lives. \n\n## Purpose\nWe can all slow the spread of COVID-19 and ‚ÄúFlatten the Curve‚Äù together. This site provides reliable information reviewed by scientists delivered in as many languages as possible to help:\n1. Understand when and how to protect ourselves;\n2. Understand how to self-isolate, quarantine, and help others stay healthy;\n3. Increase our knowledge about COVID-19 and related trends; \n4. Avoid panic and trauma by providing everyone with the right information, when we need it, and in our own language;\n5. Provide access to resources to expedite research and collaboration, such as information to participate in clinical trials.\n\nFlatten the Curve is a collective effort of people, including scientists and health experts. We are not speaking on behalf of organizations or trying to duplicate official communication channels.\n\n\n## Authors\n\nContent initially compiled by Julie McMurry, masters degree in public health from the [University of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://lshtm.ac.uk/) as well as a background in infectious diseases and vaccine development.

Emerging consensus is that containment might have been possible a few weeks ago, but is [no longer realistic](https://twitter.com/uwmnewsroom/status/1236020906956189696). Although China [bought us all time, we did not use it effectively](https://twitter.com/florian_krammer/status/1236344865924972545).

  "this-is-not-normal-flu": "## This is not a normal flu\n**Not even in the best case**\n\nThe World Health Organization estimate of 3.5% mortality rate is an average across age groups. \nAccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield, [up to 25% of cases are asymptomatic, and they are infectious. \nCOVID-19 is likely three times more infectious than flu](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/31/824155179/cdc-director-on-models-for-the-months-to-come-this-virus-is-going-to-be-with-us). \nData from Iceland [suggests as many as 50% of cases may be asymptomatic](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/europe/iceland-testing-coronavirus-intl/index.html). \nThere is very strong consensus that those aged 60+ and those with underlying conditions are the most severely impacted.\n\n![Chart showing COVID-19's mortality rate tops at 14.8% on adults over 80 years old, and is less than 1% on people under 50](/images/mortality-rate-by-age.svg)\n\nEarlier in the pandemic, there was hope that the 3.5 percent figure was grossly overestimated.\nHowever as evidence continues to emerge, there is [dwindling support for that hope](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/new-data-from-china-buttress-fears-about-high-coronavirus-fatality-rate-who-expert-says/). \nThe numbers out of South Korea are so far the most optimistic in the world ([0.7% cases were fatal](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1236914078632812544)); however, a) the South Korean population is younger on average and b) South Korea (in contrast to the USA) have been doing everything right from the earliest stages of the outbreak: they have done massive roll out of testing coupled with radical transparency, public support and [brilliant drive-through testing!](https://twitter.com/cnni/status/1234524871226482688) \nIf this strain of coronavirus is like other viruses, aggressive measures that reduce transmission may also lower the average ‚Äòdose‚Äô of viral particles that cause any given case; this might reduce the average severity of disease and decrease overall death rates. Time will tell.\n\nMoreover, even IF the true COVID-19 mortality rate is as low as 1% ([as it is so far with the Diamond Princess](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article)), that would already be [ten times higher than the mortality rate of a typical seasonal flu](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu).\n\n![Bar chart showing COVID-19 mortality rate estimated between 0.5% and 4.0%, versus Seasonal Flu at 0.1%](/images/mortality-rate.svg)\n\n> The 61,099 flu-related deaths in the U.S. during the severe flu season of 2017-2018 amounted to 0.14% of the estimated 44.8 million cases of influenza-like illness. \nThere were also an estimated 808,129 flu-related hospitalizations, for a rate of 1.8%. \nAssume a COVID-19 outbreak of similar size in the U.S., multiply the death and hospitalization estimates by five or 10, and you get some really scary numbers: 300,000 to 600,000 deaths, and [4 million to 8 million hospitalizations in a country that has 924,107 staffed hospital beds](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu) \\[for all illnesses combined\\].\n\nFor most people, infection results in a mild but still transmissible illness; **that is how it spreads.** Those that get severe illness are hit really hard. Mortality is not the full picture: Italy reports that [10% of cases need not just hospitalization but also ICU care](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232) -- and they need that care over a period of [3-6 weeks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/07/how-doctors-treat-sickest-coronavirus-patients/).

The best thing to do, if not required by your employer, is to stay home until this curve has sufficiently flattened.\n\n-   Do not dine out.\n-   Do not go to the movies - listen to the radio, watch TV, listen to podcasts, do puzzles, play board games, create an in-home disco.\n-   Do not go to church - use home rituals or streaming services.\n-   Do not go to work unless you must, and when you return have a routine for coming back so as not to bring the virus into your home.\n-   Do not go shopping for non-essentials.\n-   If you get restaurant food delivered, use a service that you can prepay and have the delivery person leave the food on the doorstep. Order well before you want to eat so you can isolate the food for a few hours, then heat it up if needed.\n-   When you go grocery shopping, wear gloves and isolate your purchases (and your gloves!) in a safe spot for a few hours before unpacking.\n-   Get outside! But keep walking. Say hi to people, get some social interaction, but get it in passing. Keep physical\n    distance from others. Don't stop and form groups.

But keep in mind that over the longer term, this isolation could have\nnegative impacts on many people's mental health. Cultivating meaningful relationships is a well established but under-appreciated determinant for all health outcomes. So DO see the people you love, but consider doing so via lower-risk activities.

  "prepare-a-hot-zone": "### Prepare a hot zone in your home in case someone falls ill\n\nPrepare your home for the possibility you'll need to isolate and care for an infected member of your household. Stock the room in advance with food that the infected person can consume with zero preparation and without face-to-face interaction with others. If you have a dedicated bathroom for the infected person, that is best. Realistically, given shortages you won't have access to a surgical mask, but if you do have one, prioritize its use on the infected person rather than caretakers. Consider use of a cloth mask for the infected person as well as for the uninfected in the same household.\n",

  "im-young": "### I'm young and healthy so I don't need to care.\n\nYoung and healthy people are generally less likely to die if infected, but this is not the point! Treatable conditions easily become deadly if the health system collapses. We are not equipped to handle hundreds or thousands of respiratory patients at the same time. In places where the outbreak is full-blown, the medical facilities are completely overwhelmed. Patients are in hallways and gymnasiums. Doctors are being forced to ration limited resources like ventilators, oxygen, and even basic supplies like surgical masks and gloves. You might be lucky, but it will likely be at the expense of others in your community.\n",
  "near-me": "### There are no infections near me.\n\nThere are almost definitely infections near you! But you cannot see them yet because there is a two week delay between the time of infection and when someone shows symptoms. During that time, the infected person is contagious and spreading the infection. For every single diagnosed case of COVID-19, there are likely hundreds of undiagnosed cases. For this reason, our only chance to avoid a massive public health disaster is if we take preventative measures before we see it everywhere.

  "cant-afford": "### I cannot afford to stay home or close my business.\n\nThis is a public health and economic crisis. Everyone is impacted. All the evidence indicates that the pandemic will force most businesses to close soon whether we want to or not. Ideally, public officials will take decisive steps to mandate social distancing as it is currently one of the only tools available to flatten the curve of infections and save lives. We can't opt out of this pandemic, but we can opt out of unnecessary risk of infection. If a tsunami was coming towards your town, would you complain about the economic cost of evacuating? This outbreak is an invisible tsunami, but unlike the countries where it hit first, we have advanced warning. The US wasted much of that head start with inaction, but one of the lessons becoming increasingly clear is that every single day counts.\n",

  "other-people": "### There's no point in staying home because some people aren't.\n\nThe goal of social distancing is to slow the rate of infections and more is better, but it is not \"all or nothing.\" In the context of an exponential growth pattern, [even small reductions have large effects](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/).
