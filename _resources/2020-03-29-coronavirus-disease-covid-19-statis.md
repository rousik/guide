"We present information on the number of deaths and cases; on why we should focus on how quickly those numbers double, not on the numbers themselves; on the prevalence of testing, and why that is important for understanding the disease; and what we can and can’t know about how lethal COVID-19 really is. We’ll also explain where we get our data from and why."
